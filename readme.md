**ChaosBox** is a **Half-Life 2** mod that brings together a *wide array of weapons and entities from other Source Engine games*, such as:
- Half-Life: Source
- Portal
- Counter Strike: Source
- Day Of Defeat: Source
- ..and much more!

**Our goal is to create the ultimate sandbox experience on ModDB.** Unlike many modifications, that rely on reused content like a Half-Life 2 Beta physics gun or a stolen spawn menu, ChaosBox features entirely original code written by our team.

## Why ChaosBox?

**ChaosBox** sets itself apart by combining **innovation, quality, and a commitment to originality**. We’ve poured effort into ensuring that the mod isn't bad, and **is** fun to play.

# Features
- Complete Lua integration
- Windows, Mac-OS, Linux, Android Support (TODO)
- PBR Shaders
- CSM (Cascade Shadow Mapping) (TODO)
- ..and much much more!
